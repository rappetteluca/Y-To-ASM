/* SymTab.h

  This file defines the interface to a simple symbol table.
  For the purposes of this module a symbol table is abstractly
  viewed as a collection of entries each associating a name
  with a single attribute which is taken to be a (void *).
  This allows the user to associate a name with an arbitrary
  structure of attribute information which the user creates
  and maintains. A symbol table can optionally reference a
  parent symbol table to support names in nested scopes.

/* CreateSymTab    Create and return a reference to a symbol table of
                   approximately Size many entries. ScopeName is a name to
                   describe the scope of the table and maybe NULL. If
                   parentTable is not NULL, the new table will reference it.

                   the table.

   DestroySymTab   Destroy all storage associated with a Symbol Table which
                   is under the table's control. This function can only free
                   storage that has been allocated by this module. Any
                   storage allocated for attributes associated with an entry
                   must be freed before the table is destroyed. This can be
                   done by creating an entryFree() function and using the
                   InvokeOnEntries() function described below. destroytable
                   returns the parent table.
